## Features

- **Food Identification**: Predicts the food item in an uploaded image using a fine-tuned MobileNetV2 model.
- **Nutritional Analysis**: Provides a detailed nutritional breakdown of the identified food item.
- **Recipe Suggestions**: Suggests recipes with similar nutritional profiles using Gemini AI.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, intuitive interface built with Streamlit.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of Python and machine learning.
- Access to a Google Cloud API Key with permissions for Google's Generative AI (Gemini).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-food-analyzer.git
   cd ai-food-analyzer
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the Pre-trained Model**

   Place the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model (`fine_tuned_mobilenet_v2.h5`) in the root directory of the project.

## Usage

### Running the App

To start the Streamlit app, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This command will launch the application in your default web browser.

### Uploading an Image

1. **Enter Your Gemini API Key**: In the text field provided, input your Gemini API key. This key is necessary to access Google's Generative AI services.

2. **Upload an Image**: Click on the "Choose an image of food" button to upload a food image (supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`).

### Viewing Results

After uploading the image, the app will:

1. Display the uploaded image.
2. Predict the food item using MobileNetV2.
3. Generate a nutritional breakdown and recipe suggestions using Gemini AI.
4. Present the results clearly on the right-hand side of the interface.
